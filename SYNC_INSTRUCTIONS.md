# Git Sync Instructions

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Local repository is clean** - All large files removed from history
- ‚úÖ **All changes committed** - Terminal panel and progress tracking complete
- ‚úÖ **Git configured** - Pull strategy set to merge
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remote sync pending** - Authentication required

## The Issue
The local and remote branches have diverged because we used `git filter-branch` to remove large target files from the git history. This is normal and expected when cleaning up a repository.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Force Push (Recommended)
When you have authentication set up, run:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin master
```
This will replace the remote repository with our clean version.

### Option 2: Reset and Pull (Alternative)
If you prefer to keep the remote as-is:
```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
# Then re-apply your changes
```

### Option 3: Create New Repository
If the remote has issues, you can create a fresh repository:
```bash
# Remove current remote
git remote remove origin

# Add new remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/vortex-fm.git

# Push to new repository
git push -u origin master
```

## Current Local State
- **Latest commit**: `e47e742` - Add F4 shortcut for terminal toggle and comprehensive progress tracking
- **Working directory**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- **Branch**: master
- **Status**: Ready for development

## What's Working
- ‚úÖ Terminal panel with F4 toggle
- ‚úÖ All file manager features
- ‚úÖ Clean git history (no large files)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Ready for continued development

## Next Steps
1. Set up git authentication (SSH keys or personal access token)
2. Choose one of the sync options above
3. Continue development from the current clean state

The repository is in perfect condition for continued development! üöÄ
