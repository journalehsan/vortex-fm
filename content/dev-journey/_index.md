# Development Journey

Welcome to the development journey of Vortex File Manager! This section documents the evolution of our file manager from concept to reality, including the challenges we faced, solutions we discovered, and the innovative Omarchy theme system we built.

## The Beginning

Vortex File Manager started as a fork of [cosmic-files](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-files), but quickly evolved into something much more ambitious. Our goal was not just to create another file manager, but to revolutionize how themes work across the entire Cosmic desktop environment.

## Key Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Forked cosmic-files and adapted it for our needs
- Implemented basic file management functionality
- Established the core architecture with Rust and libcosmic

### Phase 2: Theme Innovation
- Developed the Omarchy theme system concept
- Implemented system-wide theme synchronization
- Created the initial theme collection

### Phase 3: Integration
- Deep integration with Cosmic desktop environment
- Performance optimizations
- User experience improvements

## Development Insights

Our development journey has been documented in detail:

- [Testing Strategy](@/dev-journey/testing.md) - How we ensure quality
- [Cosmic Palette Evolution](@/dev-journey/cosmic-palette.md) - The story of our color system
- [Legacy Documentation](@/dev-journey/legacy.md) - Historical context

## Challenges and Solutions

### The Theme Synchronization Challenge

One of our biggest challenges was creating a system that could synchronize themes across all Cosmic applications. Traditional approaches wouldn't work because:

- Each application manages its own theming
- No centralized theme coordination existed
- Real-time synchronization was technically complex

**Our Solution:** The Omarchy theme system uses D-Bus communication and custom APIs to broadcast theme changes across the entire desktop environment.

### Performance Optimization

Building a file manager in Rust with libcosmic required careful attention to performance:

- Memory management for large directory listings
- Efficient file system monitoring
- Smooth UI animations and transitions

**Our Solution:** Leveraged Rust's zero-cost abstractions and libcosmic's hardware acceleration capabilities.

## Future Vision

The development journey continues as we work toward:

- Advanced file operations (copy, move, delete, rename)
- Context menus and right-click functionality
- File preview capabilities
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Enhanced theme customization
