# Omarchy Theme System: System-Wide Synchronization

The Omarchy theme system is the heart of Vortex File Manager's revolutionary approach to desktop theming. Unlike traditional file managers that only change their own appearance, Vortex FM acts as a theme orchestrator for your entire Cosmic desktop environment.

## How It Works

When you change a theme in Vortex FM, the Omarchy system:

1. **Detects the theme change** through our custom theme detection system
2. **Broadcasts the new theme** to all registered Cosmic applications
3. **Synchronizes colors** across the entire desktop environment
4. **Maintains consistency** with system-wide color schemes

## Supported Themes

Our theme collection includes carefully curated color palettes:

- **Tokyo Night** - Deep blue theme perfect for coding sessions
- **Catppuccin** - Warm mid-tone theme for comfortable use
- **Dracula** - Dark theme with vibrant purple accents
- **Everforest** - Nature-inspired green theme
- **Gruvbox** - Retro-inspired color scheme
- **Kanagawa** - Japanese-inspired dark theme
- **Matte Black** - Minimalist black theme
- **Nord** - Arctic-inspired color palette
- **Osaka Jade** - Fresh green theme
- **Ristretto** - Warm red-brown theme
- **Catppuccin Latte** - Light variant of Catppuccin
- **Rose Pine** - Soft pink theme

## Technical Implementation

The Omarchy system uses a combination of:

- **D-Bus communication** for inter-application messaging
- **Cosmic theme API** integration
- **Custom color palette management**
- **Real-time synchronization protocols**

This ensures that when you change a theme in Vortex FM, all your Cosmic applications instantly reflect the new color scheme, creating a truly unified desktop experience.

## Benefits
