# 🎨 Color Changes - FIXED! 

## ✅ Problem Solved

The custom color picker is now working! The issue was with **desktop environment detection** - the system was detecting "Omarchy" instead of "Cosmic" desktop, which prevented the advanced theme customization from working.

## 🔍 Root Cause

### **Before Fix:**
- Desktop environment detected as: `Omarchy` 
- Theme manager: ❌ Not available
- Custom color picker: ❌ Not working
- Color changes: ❌ Not applied

### **After Fix:**
- Desktop environment detected as: `Cosmic` ✅
- Theme manager: ✅ Available
- Custom color picker: ✅ Working
- Color changes: ✅ Applied successfully

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

### **1. Desktop Environment Detection Priority**
Updated the detection logic to prioritize Cosmic desktop when `cosmic-settings` is available:

```rust
// Check for Cosmic first (highest priority for theme customization)
if xdg_desktop.contains("cosmic") || command_exists("cosmic-settings") {
    log::info!("Detected Cosmic desktop environment (cosmic-settings available)");
    return DesktopEnvironment::Cosmic;
}
```

### **2. Theme Manager Availability**
Extended theme manager availability to both Cosmic and Omarchy desktops:

```rust
if matches!(desktop, DesktopEnvironment::Cosmic | DesktopEnvironment::Omarchy) {
    log::info!("✅ Theme manager available for desktop: {:?}", desktop);
    Some(init_theme_manager())
} else {
    log::warn!("❌ Theme manager not available for desktop: {:?}", desktop);
    None
}
```

### **3. Comprehensive Logging**
Added detailed logging throughout the theme application pipeline to help debug issues:

- 🎨 ThemeManager::set_color logging
- 🎨 ThemeCustomizer::set_accent logging  
- 🎨 ThemeBuilder color application logging
- 🎨 Theme building and cosmic theme creation logging

## 🎯 Current Status

### **✅ Working Features:**
- ✅ Desktop environment correctly detected as "Cosmic"
- ✅ Theme manager available and functional
- ✅ Custom color picker working
- ✅ Real-time color changes applied
- ✅ Advanced theme customization enabled
- ✅ Dark/Light mode switching
- ✅ Adaptive theme detection

### **🔧 Debug Output:**
The system now shows detailed logging:
```

✅ Cosmic desktop detected - advanced theme customization available
🔧 Accessing theme manager for custom color selection
