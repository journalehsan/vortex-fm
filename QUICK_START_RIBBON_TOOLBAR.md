## 🖱️ How to Use

### View Toggle (Grid ↔ List)
```
Location: Toolbar, View Control Group (between Paste and Sort buttons)

Grid Mode:    [🔲] (grid icon) → Click → List Mode: [☰] (list icon)
List Mode:    [☰] (list icon) → Click → Grid Mode: [🔲] (grid icon)
```

### Sort Cycling (4-way toggle)
```
Location: Toolbar, View Control Group (after View button)

[⇅] Always shows same icon
Click repeatedly to cycle:
  Name → Date → Size → Trashed → Name ...

Tooltip updates each click to show current sort
```

## 🎨 Transparent Background Feature

Each button container now has a transparent background:
```rust
.style(|_theme| {
    let mut style = widget::container::Style::default();
    style.background = None; // ← Transparent!
    style
})
```

**Result:** Icons visible on ANY background color! ✨
