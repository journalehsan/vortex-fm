## Feature Testing Checklist

### Display
- [ ] Terminal appears when opened
- [ ] Dark background with light text
- [ ] Toolbar shows current directory path
- [ ] Input field shows "$ " prompt
- [ ] Output scrolls when needed

### Toolbar Buttons
- [ ] **Position Button** - Toggles between Bottom and Right layout
- [ ] **Sync Button** - Updates working directory from file manager

### Command Execution
- [ ] Can type in input field
- [ ] Enter executes command
- [ ] Output appears in scrollable area
- [ ] Input field clears after execution
- [ ] Command appears in output as "$ command"

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid command shows error
- [ ] Permission denied displays error
- [ ] Non-existent command shows "not found"

### Multiple Commands
- [ ] Can execute several commands in sequence
- [ ] Output history is maintained
- [ ] All previous commands visible above

## Sample Test Session

```
Step 1: Open terminal (Ctrl+`)
→ Should see toolbar and empty output area

Step 2: Type: pwd
→ Should see: $ pwd followed by current path

Step 3: Type: ls -la
→ Should see: $ ls -la followed by detailed file listing

Step 4: Type: date
→ Should see: $ date followed by current date/time

Step 5: Click Sync button
→ Toolbar path should stay current with file manager

Step 6: Type: echo "Terminal Works!"
→ Should see: Terminal Works!

Step 7: Close terminal (Ctrl+`)
→ Terminal panel disappears
```

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ What Should Work
- Terminal opens/closes smoothly
- Commands execute immediately
- Output displays with history
- Toolbar functions correctly
- Directory sync works
- No error messages about "readonly"
- Input field remains editable

### ⚠️ Known Limitations
- **No colors** - ANSI codes not parsed yet
- **No history navigation** - Can't use arrow keys to go through history
- **Single session** - Only one terminal window
- **No copy/paste menu** - Right-click doesn't show options

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal Doesn't Open
1. Check if Ctrl+` is working (might be remapped)
2. Look for "Terminal" button in toolbar
3. Check app logs for errors

### Commands Don't Execute
1. Verify Enter key works
2. Try simple command like `pwd`
3. Check if input field is focused (shows cursor)

### No Output Appearing
1. Check output area isn't empty (should have scrollbar)
2. Try a command that definitely produces output (`ls`)
3. Verify terminal is actually visible

### Toolbar Not Showing
1. Reopen terminal
2. Check if window is tall enough for toolbar
3. Verify toolbar buttons are clickable

## Log Messages to Look For

When terminal is working, you should see in logs:
```
📺 Using Fallback terminal strategy
🖥️ TerminalToggle message received!
🖥️ Creating new terminal panel...
🖥️ Terminal panel message processed
```

## Performance Notes

- **Small commands** (pwd, ls) - < 100ms
- **Medium commands** (find) - 1-5 seconds
- **Large output** - Scrolls smoothly, maintains history
- **Multiple commands** - Queued and executed in order

## Next Features (Planned)

1. **Colors** - ANSI color code support
2. **History** - Arrow keys for command history
3. **Copy/Paste** - Right-click context menu
4. **Shell Detection** - Use your preferred shell
5. **Tabs** - Multiple terminal sessions

## Quick Commands to Test

```bash
# Works immediately
pwd                     # Current directory
whoami                  # Current user
date                    # Current date/time
echo "test"            # Text output

# Works with output
ls                      # List files
ls -la                  # Detailed listing
find . -type f         # Find files

# Works with exit codes
false                   # Shows exit code 1
true                    # Shows exit code 0

# Works with errors
invalidcommand123      # Shows "not found"
/invalid/path          # Shows "No such file"
```

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Check compilation:** `cargo check` should have 0 errors
2. **Verify files modified:** Check TERMINAL_COMPLETE_FIX_REPORT.md for changes
3. **Review terminal_panel.rs:** Should have toolbar rendering
4. **Check app.rs:** Should have TerminalPanelMessage handler
5. **Look at logs:** Run with `RUST_LOG=debug` for verbose output

## Success Indicator

You'll know it's working when:
1. ✅ Terminal appears when you press Ctrl+`
2. ✅ Toolbar shows with path and buttons
3. ✅ You can type commands in the input field
4. ✅ Commands execute and show output
5. ✅ No error messages or warnings
6. ✅ Toolbar buttons are clickable

**Your terminal is now ready for use!** 🎉
