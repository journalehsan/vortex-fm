# Ribbon Toolbar Improvements

## Overview
The ribbon toolbar now features improved icon visibility and space-efficient toggle buttons for view mode and sort options, eliminating the need for problematic dropdown menus.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Icon Visibility Fix - Transparent Backgrounds** ✅
**Problem:** Icons were not visible when displayed with accent color backgrounds in dropdown menus.

**Solution:** All button containers now use transparent backgrounds with explicit styling:
```rust
.style(theme::Container::custom(|theme| {
    cosmic::iced_core::container::Appearance {
        text_color: Some(theme.palette().text.standard),
        background: None,  // Transparent background
        border: cosmic::iced::Border::default(),
        shadow: Default::default(),
    }
}))
```

**Benefits:**
- Icons are now always visible with proper text color from the theme
- No conflicting background colors from accent color or button press states
- Consistent appearance across all themes
- Better accessibility with proper color contrast

### 2. **View Toggle Button** ✅
**Functionality:**
- Click once: Switches between Grid View and List View
- Click again: Toggles back
- No dropdown menu needed - uses a single icon button that cycles through modes

**Current Implementation:**
- Shows `view-grid-symbolic` icon when in Grid mode
- Shows `view-list-symbolic` icon when in List mode
- Tooltip indicates which mode you're switching to

**Tooltip Examples:**
- Grid View: "Grid View (click to toggle to List)"
- List View: "List View (click to toggle to Grid)"

### 3. **Sort Toggle Button** ✅
**Functionality:**
- Click to cycle through sort options:
  1. Name
  2. Modified (Date)
  3. Size
  4. Trashed On
  5. Back to Name (cycles)
- Single icon button with changing tooltip

**Current Implementation:**
- Shows `view-sort-ascending-symbolic` icon
- Tooltip shows current sort mode and indicates "click to cycle"

**Sort Cycle:**
```
Name → Modified → Size → TrashedOn → Name → ...
```

### 4. **Minimalist Toolbar Design** ✅
**Spacing:**
- Small gaps (4px) between related buttons
- Medium gaps (12px) between button groups
- Padding of 8px around the entire toolbar

**Button Groups:**
1. **File Operations:** New File, New Folder
2. **Edit Operations:** Cut, Copy, Paste
3. **View Controls:** View Toggle, Sort Toggle
4. **System Actions:** Delete/Trash, Terminal

## Why Toggle Buttons Instead of Dropdowns?

### Problems with Dropdown Menus in iced/libcosmic:
1. **Complex implementation** - Dropdown widgets are difficult to work with
2. **UI clutter** - Takes up space when expanded
3. **Icon visibility** - Icons don't display well with accent color backgrounds in dropdowns
4. **Non-intuitive** - Users expect dropdowns to stay open or provide more options

### Benefits of Toggle Approach:
1. **Space efficient** - Only takes up one icon button's worth of space
2. **Intuitive** - Click-to-cycle is familiar to most users
3. **Fast access** - No menus to open or navigate
4. **Better accessibility** - Clearer visual feedback with current state
5. **Tooltips provide guidance** - Users know what happens on next click

## Technical Details

### File Modified
- `src/views/ribbon_toolbar.rs`

### Key Changes:
1. All `container()` widgets wrapping icons now use custom styling
2. Background is set to `None` for transparency
3. Text color explicitly uses theme's standard text color
4. Toggle logic already existed and was properly integrated

### Message Flow:
```
RibbonMessage::ToggleView 
  → app.rs RibbonMessage handler
  → Cycles view in ribbon_toolbar state
  → Emits Message::TabView with new view
  → Updates active tab with new view mode

RibbonMessage::ToggleSort
  → app.rs RibbonMessage handler
  → Cycles sort in ribbon_toolbar state
  → Emits Message::SetSort with new sort option
  → Updates active tab with new sort mode
```

## UI Behavior Examples

### View Toggle
```
User clicks view button (currently showing Grid icon)
↓
Icon changes to List icon
↓
View switches to List mode
↓
Next click shows Grid icon again
```

### Sort Toggle
```
User clicks sort button (currently showing "Sort by Name")
↓
Tooltip now shows "Sort by Date (click to cycle)"
↓
Sort switches to Modified date
↓
Click again cycles to Size, then TrashedOn, then back to Name
```

## Theme Integration
- Icons use theme's standard text color via `theme.palette().text.standard`
- No hardcoded colors - respects light/dark theme switching
- Works with all theme variants (Cosmic, Dracula, Monokai, etc.)

## Future Enhancements
1. Add keyboard shortcuts for faster cycling (e.g., Ctrl+V for view toggle)
2. Add animation transitions when switching views
3. Save user's preferred view/sort preference across sessions
4. Add more sort options (Type, Owner, Permissions, etc.)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify icons are visible in all themes (light and dark)
- [ ] Test view toggle functionality (Grid ↔ List)
- [ ] Test sort cycling through all options
- [ ] Check tooltip text is accurate
- [ ] Verify button spacing looks correct
- [ ] Test on different screen resolutions
- [ ] Check keyboard accessibility
- [ ] Verify no compilation warnings or errors
